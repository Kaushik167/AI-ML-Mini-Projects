# 🧠 Simple Sentiment Text Analysis in Python

A Python project that performs sentiment analysis on text to determine whether the sentiment is **positive**, **neutral**, or **negative**.  
This project was created by following an online YouTube tutorial as part of my journey to learn and improve my Python skills.

## 🎯 What Is This Project About?

This project analyzes text input and evaluates its emotional tone using Natural Language Processing (NLP).  
It assigns a **sentiment polarity score** to the text and classifies it as positive, neutral, or negative.

This is useful for:
- Analyzing reviews
- Understanding user feedback
- Learning the basics of NLP in Python

## ⚙️ How Does It Work?

1. The user provides a piece of text (or text is read from a source).
2. The program processes the text using the **TextBlob** library.
3. TextBlob calculates sentiment polarity:
   - Positive (> 0)
   - Neutral (= 0)
   - Negative (< 0)
4. The sentiment result is printed to the terminal.
