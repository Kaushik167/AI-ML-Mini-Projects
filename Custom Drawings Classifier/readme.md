# 🎨 Custom Drawing Classifier in Python

A Python machine learning project that builds a **custom drawing classifier** capable of recognizing hand‑drawn sketches using computer vision and machine learning.  
This project was created by following the YouTube tutorial: *AI Custom Drawings Classifier with Python*.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

This project uses **image data of drawings** to train a classifier model that can **recognize different sketch categories**.  
It demonstrates how to collect, preprocess, train, and evaluate a model that can classify simple hand‑drawn images.

This is a great project for learning:
- Basic computer vision
- Image data preprocessing
- Model training and evaluation
- Working with machine learning libraries in Python

## 🛠 How It Works

1. **Dataset Collection**  
   - Images or drawing sketches are collected for each class/category.

2. **Data Preprocessing**  
   - Images are resized, normalized, and organized into training/test sets.

3. **Model Selection & Training**  
   - A machine learning model (e.g., a neural network, CNN, or classic classifier) is trained on labeled drawing data.

4. **Model Evaluation**  
   - Evaluate model performance on test images.

5. **Prediction**  
   - The trained model predicts the class of new hand‑drawn sketches.

6. **Optional GUI**  
   - A GUI or interactive interface may be added to draw and classify in real time.
